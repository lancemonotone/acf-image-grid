## Instructions

- Ensure you understand the context of the codebase before you begin.
- Don't add any extra functionality.
- Update this document as each phase is completed.

## Codebase Scope

### Primary File Location

- **Main JavaScript File**: `wp-content/plugins/acf-image-grid/blocks/acf-image-grid/assets/js/script.js`
- **File Size**: ~1117 lines of vanilla JavaScript (reduced from ~645 lines)
- **Class**: `ACFImageGridSlideshow` (lines 401-1117)

### Related Files and Dependencies

- **CSS**: Likely located in `wp-content/plugins/acf-image-grid/blocks/acf-image-grid/assets/css/` (not analyzed)
- **PHP Templates**: Located in `wp-content/plugins/acf-image-grid/blocks/acf-image-grid/` (not analyzed)
- **WordPress Integration**: ACF (Advanced Custom Fields) block implementation

### Entry Points

- **DOM Ready Event**: Line 774 - `document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", ...)`
- **Initialization Selector**: `.slot.primary[data-slideshow-id]` elements
- **Class Constructor**: Line 254 - `constructor(element)`

### Key Methods Refactored

- ✅ `ImageErrorHandler` - Lines 7-85 (centralized error handling class)
- ✅ `SpinnerManager` - Lines 88-185 (centralized spinner management class)
- ✅ `DebugManager` - Lines 188-250 (centralized debug functionality class)
- ✅ `loadImageWithSpinner()` - Lines 270-350 (unified image loading logic)
- ✅ `loadImage()` - Lines 352-360 (simplified wrapper method)
- ✅ `loadSlideImage()` - Lines 460-480 (eliminated duplication)

### External Dependencies

- **Spinner Image**: `/blocks/acf-image-grid/assets/images/tribe-loading.gif` (dynamically loaded from plugin)
- **No jQuery**: Pure vanilla JavaScript implementation
- **Intersection Observer API**: For performance optimization
- **Fetch API**: For image loading (implicit)

## Overview

Refactor the ACF Image Grid Slideshow JavaScript code to improve DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) compliance and overall code quality. The current implementation has significant code duplication, particularly around image loading logic, spinner management, and error handling.

## Current Issues Identified

### 1. ✅ Image Loading Logic Duplication - RESOLVED

- ~~`loadImage()` method (lines 67-200) and first slide loading logic in `loadSlideImage()` (lines 280-330) have nearly identical functionality~~
- ~~Duplicated spinner creation, loading states, and error handling~~
- ~~Repeated event listener management patterns~~

**Resolution**: Created unified `loadImageWithSpinner()` method that consolidates all image loading logic with configurable options.

### 2. ✅ Spinner Management Duplication - RESOLVED

- ~~Spinner creation and visibility logic repeated in multiple places~~
- ~~Manual spinner insertion duplicated across different loading contexts~~
- ~~Inconsistent spinner removal timing~~

**Resolution**: Created dedicated `SpinnerManager` class that centralizes all spinner-related operations with consistent behavior and timing.

### 3. ✅ Error Handling Duplication - RESOLVED

- ~~Error handling logic for failed image loads duplicated between loading methods~~
- ~~Repeated error indicator creation and styling~~
- ~~Duplicated event listener cleanup in error scenarios~~

**Resolution**: Created dedicated `ImageErrorHandler` class that centralizes all error handling logic with consistent styling and behavior.

### 4. ✅ Debug Overlay Logic Duplication - RESOLVED

- ~~Debug overlay creation and attachment logic appears in both loading paths~~
- ~~Repeated filename extraction from URLs~~

**Resolution**: Created dedicated `DebugManager` class that centralizes all debug functionality with consistent behavior and output formatting.

### 5. Loading State Management Duplication

- Adding/removing loading classes duplicated
- Managing `loadedImages` Set logic repeated
- Container-specific loading state updates duplicated

## Refactoring Goals

1. **Eliminate code duplication** by extracting common functionality into reusable methods
2. **Improve maintainability** by centralizing related logic
3. **Enhance readability** by reducing method complexity
4. **Ensure consistency** in error handling and loading states
5. **Maintain existing functionality** while improving code structure
